Well this feature exists and it&#8217;s in a slightly unexpected place &#8230; QuickTime Player.

### How to make a screen recording with QuickTime Player

*   Launch QuickTime Player from your Applications.

*   Click &#8220;File&#8221; -> &#8220;New Screen Recording&#8221;

&nbsp;

*   This will bring up the &#8220;Screen Recording&#8221; dialogue.

*   Click the red recording icon on the dialogue box.

*    You will then be given the option to click once to record the whole screen or to drag a box over the area you want to record.

&nbsp;

*   So say for example you want to record the contents of your browser window but nothing else you can just drag a box over the window, and don&#8217;t worry about not being perfectly accurate with your box as you will be able to modify it before you start recording.

&nbsp;

*   You will see in the middle of the recording area a &#8220;Start Recording&#8221; button. Once you&#8217;re happy with your recording area click that and away you go.

*   Then once you&#8217;re done recording you just click the &#8220;Stop&#8221; icon on the toolbar next to the clock.

*   Your new screen recording will open in QuickTime player and you just need to press &#8220;⌘ + S&#8221; to save it.
